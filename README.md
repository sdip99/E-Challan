## E-Challan System ##


E-Challan is an online application, which can be used to make challans on the vehicles which have violated traffic rules and motor vehicle act. Separate challans  are made for 2 wheelers, 4 wheelers, and passenger vehicles, professional/private vehicles.. Traffic Police can generate Challan only by one click which will be easy and less time consuming. All Traffic Polices can be easily managed by only one click. We can store Challan generated by every Traffic Police.  It is very tough and challenging to store and maintain Paper Challan, In case of E-Challan we can access data saved on specific date, month, or year and also can maintain it as we want only at one place. High order manager can track all tasks and activity of every Polices about their work through our E-Challan Web Pages. This system will helpful to our Government and also for Police Department.
